Dovrebbe andare bene cos√¨


Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [My UniCal webpage](https://www.unical.it/portale/strutture/dipartimenti_240/dibest/docenti/montesanto/)

## My courses

## [Data Visualization in R](http://nickstrayer.me/visualization_in_r/)

- An RMarkdown presentation on the common mistakes made in visualization and how to fix them.
